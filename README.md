# Index

A simple module for fixing the height issue in mobile browsers where the address bar is visible, and the content does not fill the full height of the screen.

Is intended to solve this issue automagically ðŸª„

- https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/

From the latter of these pages I took most of the cue to create this module, so kudos to Louis Hoebregts (@Mamboleoo)  

## Installation

```bash
npm install mobile-height-fix
```

## Usage
After importing the module

- The body will be set to have a minimum height of 100% of the height of the screen

- A new custom property will be available, `--vh` that represents the 1% of the height of the screen
  You can use this css variable in this way>  

```css
    height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100)
```


### Importing in HTML (recommended)

Add the following script tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file to ensure that the script is executed as soon as possible:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Website Title</title>
    <script type="module" src="node_modules/mobile-height-fix/MobileHeightFix.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Importing in JavaScript

If you are using a bundler or a more complex JavaScript setup, you can import the module in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
// Import the MobileHeightFix class
import MobileHeightFix from 'mobile-height-fix';

// Create an instance and initialize the fix
const heightFix = new MobileHeightFix();
```

### Explanation

The `MobileHeightFix` class provides a solution to the issue on mobile browsers where the address bar is visible, and the content does not fill the full height of the screen. It sets a custom property (`--vh`) on the HTML root element to reflect the actual height of the viewport.

The script automatically sets the full height when it is initialized and adds a resize event listener to handle changes in viewport size.

## API

### `MobileHeightFix()`

Constructor that initializes the `MobileHeightFix` instance.

### `setFullHeight()`

Sets the full height of the window by updating the `--vh` custom property on the HTML root element.

### `init()`

Initializes the fix by calling `setFullHeight()` and adding a resize event listener.

## Example

```javascript
// Import the MobileHeightFix class
import MobileHeightFix from 'mobile-height-fix';

// Create an instance and initialize the fix
const heightFix = new MobileHeightFix();

// Will update the --vh value
heightFix.setFullHeight();
```

### Explanation

#### Script (No Import/Export)

The `Index` script provides a solution to the issue on mobile browsers where the address bar is visible, and the content does not fill the full height of the screen. It automatically sets a custom property (`--vh`) on the HTML root element to reflect the actual height of the viewport. The script is designed to work without explicit import/export and automatically sets the full height when it is loaded. It also adds a resize event listener to handle changes in viewport size.

#### Module (Import/Export)

The `Index` module can be imported in more complex JavaScript setups. It provides the same functionality as the script but allows you to use modern JavaScript features like import/export. To use this option, import the module and create an instance to initialize the fix.
